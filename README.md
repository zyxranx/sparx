# sparx
Created to be used to buy stuff. We dont care about exchanges listing at all.
- At least its not a POS.

Well, 
Like the slogan suggest this cryptocurrency is intented to be money.

Basic principles:

- To avoid being listed by exchanges.
- To seek to build bridges and partners that will acept it as payment.
  - Step One is to create faucets.
  - Step two find partner to accept Sparx as payment for their services.
      - First targets:
      - Webhost services
      - Ad networks
- Do you have an idea to motivate people to use/buy the Sparx even not being listed on exchanges? yes, we do.
  
  The focus of the (future) team will be 90% on creating partnership so we can create value for the coin in a nature way;
- Its a currency its not a token.
- Its not intented to be a "trade-friendly currency".
- We don't care about exchange listing at all.
  Thats all for now guys.
